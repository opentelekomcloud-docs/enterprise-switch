Functions
=========

Enterprise Switches
-------------------

Enterprise switches support Layer 2 connection gateways (L2CGs) now. An L2CG is a virtual tunnel gateway that can work with Direct Connect or VPN to establish network communications between cloud and on-premises networks at Layer 2. The gateway allows you to migrate workloads in data centers or private clouds to the cloud without changing subnets and IP addresses.

Layer 2 Connections
-------------------

A Layer 2 connection enable a local Layer 2 connection subnet and a remote VXLAN switch to communicate at Layer 2. Each Layer 2 connection connects a local and a remote Layer 2 connection subnet.

After an enterprise switch is created, you need to create a Layer 2 connection.

For details, see :ref:`Creating a Layer 2 Connection <esw_ug_0007>`.

Monitoring
----------

Cloud Eye lets you keep a close eye on the performance and resource utilization of enterprise switches, ensuring enterprise switch reliability and availability. You can also configure Cloud Eye to alert you of any potential issues in enterprise switches in real time.

For details, see :ref:`Cloud Eye Monitoring <esw_ug_0013>`.
